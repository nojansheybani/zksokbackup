# MPC-in-the-Head

MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) ZKPs are a class of ZK protocols that take a completely novel approach towards proof generation and verification. The primary cryptographic basis is secure multiparty computation (MPC). The prover essentially mimics the MPC parties "in its head" to compute the proof.
