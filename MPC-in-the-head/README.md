# MPC-in-the-Head

MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) ZKPs are a class of ZK protocols that take a completely novel approach towards proof generation and verification. The primary cryptographic basis is secure multiparty computation (MPC). The prover essentially mimics the MPC parties "in its head" to compute the proof.

NOTE: Some of the frameworks we highlight here are better classified as "Interactive" proofs, as they are interactive proofs that were modified to be zero-knowledge. However, all of them use MPC to some extent. If you believe a framework has been classified incorrectly, please reach out.
