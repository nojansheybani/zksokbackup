# zk-STARKs

Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (zk-STARKs) which can be thought of as interactive oracle proof (IOP)-based zk-SNARKS, completely remove the dependence on trusted setup. Rather than using randomness from a trusted party, these protocols use publicly verifiable randomness for generating the necessary parameters for proof generation and verification.
